<h1>Family Based Immigration</h1><h3>Contention 1: Economy </h3><p>L</p><h4>Low <u>labor market flexibility</u>, low <u>population growth</u>, and an <u>aging workforce</u> is undermining the <u>dynamism</u> of the US economy – that’s vital to <u>economic</u> <u>resilience</u>, job growth, new startups, and sustained innovation.&nbsp;</h4><p><strong>Lettieri, 17 </strong>– President of the Economic Innovation Group (John, Joint Economic Committee Hearing on the Decline of Economic Opportunity in the United States: Causes and Consequences, 4/5, https://medium.com/the-investing-in-opportunity-act/joint-economic-committee-hearing-on-the-decline-of-economic-opportunity-in-the-united-states-fe6d170ea762&nbsp;//DH</p><p><br></p><p><u>The economy today is suffering from too little change</u>, not too much. I realize this is a provocative claim in the age of the gig economy, automation, and the dawn of artificial intelligence. But the fact is <u style="background-color: yellow;">Americans are less likely to start a business, move to another region, or switch jobs</u><u> now than at any other time on record</u>. Indeed, <u style="background-color: yellow;">the</u><u> U.S. </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">economy is</u><u> quickly becoming </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">less dynamic</u><u> in</u> nearly <u>every measurable respect</u>.</p><p>Why does this matter? If we believe the problem is too much change, it follows that policy priorities will be oriented around mitigating disruptions and hedging against risk. On the other hand, if we understand the economy has grown too static and too risk averse in too many areas, the logical response is a dynamism-boosting policy agenda — precisely what I believe is urgently needed.</p><p><u>Dynamism</u> <u>can be understood</u>, in essence, <u>as the rate</u> and scale <u>of economic churn</u>. It fuels an economy’s process of creative destruction, <em style="background-color: yellow;">enhancing our ability to adapt</em> and allocate resources in a more efficient manner. Historically, <u>the high-churn nature of the U.S. economy </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">acted as a kind of </u><em style="background-color: yellow;">shock absorber</em><u style="background-color: yellow;"> in</u><u> times of </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">economic change</u><u> or trauma.</u></p><p>Let’s start by assessing the state of dynamism today through three important and interrelated measures: the startup rate, job turnover rate, and domestic migration rate.</p><p><u>New firms are becoming scarce</u>. <u style="background-color: yellow;">At the core</u><u> of the broad decline in economic dynamism </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">is a steep drop in new firm formation</u>. <u>The startup rate collapsed</u> during the Great Recession to its lowest point on record — dipping below the closure rate for the first time. Even as the broader economy has improved, the startup rate has barely budged and remains mired at 8.0 percent — narrowly outpacing the firm closure rate (this is important, as we will see below). Even in absolute terms, the economy produced 25 percent fewer new firms in 2014 than it did before the crisis. The decline is pervasive across all regions and industry sectors.</p><p>This is a deeply troubling development. <u style="background-color: yellow;">New firms</u><u> are the “creative” part of creative destruction. They help </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">keep the economy in a</u><u> constant </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">state of rebirth</u><u> by replacing dying industries, </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">fostering competition</u><u> with incumbent companies, </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">and producing new</u><u> and higher wage </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">jobs</u>. When they disappear, the cycle of creative destruction falls out of balance.</p><p>It is worth noting that the rate at which firms close has remained fairly stable over the past 30 years. In fact, given all the talk about disruption these days, one might be surprised to see the closure rate currently near its lowest point on record. At least as far as businesses go, the dynamism problem is rooted in anemic birth rates, not spiking closures.</p><p><u style="background-color: yellow;">Job turnover has plummeted</u>. <u>Job turnover is an important sign of labor market flexibility</u>. High turnover was once a key feature of the U.S. economy but has declined substantially from a high of 12.4 percent annually in 1999 to a low of only 7.2 percent in 2015. In other words, only one in every 14 positions turned over in 2015. Disadvantaged workers are the ones most acutely impacted by lower turnover rates. Without churn in the labor market, it’s simply more difficult to find an unoccupied rung on the career ladder. For individuals, <u>low job churn has negative implications for wages</u>. For the broader economy, there is evidence that <em style="background-color: yellow;">slower rates</em><em> of churn meaningfully </em><em style="background-color: yellow;">reduced GDP growth</em> during early stages of the economic recovery.</p><p>People are staying put. Americans are far less geographically mobile than they once were. High rates of internal migration historically served as an important adjustment mechanism for the U.S. economy, mitigating downturns as workers moved to areas more rich in opportunity. The domestic migration rate throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s was consistently between 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent, and it was above 3.0 percent as recently as the late 1990s. Since then it has fallen by roughly half, settling to a historic low of 1.5 percent. While demographic factors impact domestic migration, the bulk of the trend can be attributed to declining business dynamism. As fewer firms open and close, fewer employment opportunities emerge, and thus, fewer people have reason to move long distances.</p><p>Consequences of Declining Dynamism</p><p>Let’s now explore some of the consequences of a low-dynamism economy.</p><p>Declining Stock of U.S. Firms</p><p>The rapid decline in the U.S. startup rate has ushered in the modern economy’s first period of a shrinking U.S. business sector. Prior to 2008, the vast majority of U.S. metro areas saw more businesses open than close every year. In fact, the share of metro areas generating a net increase in firms in a given year never fell below 80 percent, fueling a steady increase in the total number of firms nationwide — even during years of recession (Figure 4). From 1977 to 2007, the U.S. economy generated an average net increase of roughly 117,000 firms per year (Figure 5).</p><p>This trend reversed entirely with the Great Recession. At its worst, nearly 90 percent of metros experienced a net decrease in firms in 2009. Perhaps of even greater concern is that the national recovery has not brought a return to normalcy. As of 2014, more than 60 percent of metro areas continued to lose more firms than they were creating. Even the economy’s best year for net firm formation since the recession (2012) fell far short of its worst year prior to 2008.</p><p>To underscore the severe and unprecedented nature of this reversal: Prior to the recession, the United States had never recorded a year-over-year decrease in the number of firms. By 2014, however, the economy’s total stock of firms was 182,000 smaller than it was in 2007 — in spite of an increase of $1.1 trillion in real GDP.</p><p>Fewer Jobs</p><p><u>Workers suffer in an economy with fewer firms competing for their labor and less labor market turnover.</u> <u>New firms are the economy’s most potent engine for net job creation </u>and play an underappreciated role in keeping the labor market healthy. In fact, established firms as a cohort tend to shed more jobs than they create in an average year; only new firms are consistently net job creators. Thus, the meager startup rate has served to mute both the quality and quantity of job growth during the current recovery. Our conservative estimate is that <u style="background-color: yellow;">the</u><u> cumulative </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">deficit from</u><u> a </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">missing</u><u> generation of new </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">firms between 2007 and 2014 was 3.4 million job</u><span style="background-color: yellow;">s</span>. At a time when nearly 15 percent of prime working-age men are out of the labor force, <u style="background-color: yellow;">diminished startup activity will continue to pose a major impediment</u><u> to</u> the goal of expanding access to opportunity through <u>quality employment.</u></p><p>Incumbency and Market Concentration</p><p>The economy is now dominated by older incumbent firms who are thriving in an environment with fewer new challengers and weaker competitive pressures. Firms that are at least 16 years old are claiming an ever-larger share of the business sector and now employ nearly three-quarters of the country’s workforce, up from 60 percent in the early 1990s. Corporate profits, which normally average around 6 percent of GDP, have averaged over 9 percent of GDP over the recovery. Market concentration is becoming more pervasive. Two-thirds of U.S. industries saw an increase in concentration between 1997 and 2012, with the top firms claiming a larger and larger share of total revenue.</p><p>To be clear: Some degree of market concentration is not inherently bad for consumers or the broader economy. However, remarkably high and persistent profits alongside pervasive concentration are a warning sign of economic rents. What should be temporary rewards in a competitive economy now resemble perpetual rewards to incumbency. And the steady creep of regulatory complexity only serves to strengthen incumbents’ hold on the market. <u>Another reason to be concerned by the graying of the business sector is its impact on innovation and productivity</u>. An array of research indicates that <u style="background-color: yellow;">firms tend to become more risk averse as they age, while new companies are</u><u> disproportionately </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">likely to bring radical innovations</u><u> to market</u>. But with the number of initial public offerings down significantly since the 1990s and number of acquisitions going up, much of the innovation generated by today’s new companies simply goes to directly strengthening — instead of challenging — an incumbent.</p><p>Rising Geographic Inequality and Concentrated Growth</p><p>The economy has undergone massive changes in recent decades, but few are as obvious as the shifting geographic distribution of new jobs and businesses. The last recession and subsequent years have accelerated a trend towards geographic concentration after decades of decentralizing growth that spread economic activity to more locales. An increasingly narrow set of places are responsible for national rates of growth as an increasingly wide swath of places get left behind. While regional variations have always been a fact of life, the relationship between place and opportunity appears more pronounced than ever.</p><p>As the map of economic growth and recovery has changed, so too has the nature of economic opportunity for millions of Americans. Consider these findings:</p><p><strong>(chart omitted)</strong></p><p>The local benefits of dynamism are accruing to smaller shares of the population. For example, fully half of the net increase in U.S. firms from 2010 to 2014 was located in only five metro areas: Houston, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami and New York. These places were home to only 17 percent of the country’s jobs. Compare that to the 1992 to 1996 period, in which 30 metro areas — spread throughout the entire country and housing 40 percent of U.S. employment — produced half the net growth in firms. It is crucial to note: This trend is the result of most places doing worse, not a few places doing better than ever. For example, the New York metro area produced roughly the same increase in firms over the last three economic recovery periods. In other words, the pie itself is getting smaller and the biggest slices are going to resilient large metro areas. The trend with firms and metro areas holds true for counties and business establishments as well. This is important because if fewer new firms were still producing a broad and healthy distribution of growth in business establishments, the detrimental effects would likely be less severe. Instead, we see that half of the net growth in establishments from 2010 to 2014 occurred in just 20 counties home to only 17 percent of the U.S. population. This is again a far cry from the 1992 to 1996 period, during which 125 counties home to roughly a third of the population generated half the net establishment growth.</p><p>Counties losing business establishments have more than tripled over the past three recoveries. The percentage of counties seeing a net decline in business establishments during national recoveries went from 17 percent from 1992 to 1996 to 59 percent from 2010 to 2014. As a result, most U.S. counties had fewer business establishments in 2014 than they did in 2010. Counties seeing a net establishment loss were home to nearly one third of the U.S. population.</p><p>The early recovery passed over the neediest communities. National figures are increasingly unreliable in telling a local story. For example, EIG’s Distressed Communities Index (DCI) project found that U.S. zip codes in the bottom quintile of prosperity saw significant ongoing losses of both jobs and business establishments during the first four years of the national economic recovery. On average, they saw a -6.7 percent change in employment and a -8.3 percent change in establishments. These are places spread throughout every region and housing over 50 million Americans — often adjacent to highly prosperous centers of economic growth. Meanwhile, the top quintile of zip codes saw employment gains of 17.4 percent and establishment growth of 8.8 percent. These findings underscore the consistent disconnect between the national narrative of steady recovery and the deep anxiety many Americans still feel about their own local economies.</p><p>Small and rural counties experienced a stunning reversal of fortune over the past two decades. Low-density counties went from a 16 percent employment growth rate in the 1992 to 1996 period to a 4.9 percent growth rate from 2010 to 2014. Worse, over the same period, those counties went from leading the nation with a 9.0 percent establishment growth rate to last place with a rate of -1.0 percent. While many flourishing rural and small town communities remain, the landscape of opportunity and economic growth has clearly shifted toward higher density locales.</p><p>The largest counties were the clear winners of the 2010s recovery. As fortunes have faded elsewhere, counties with over one million residents led the nation in employment and establishment growth rates for the first time. This defies the conventional wisdom that growth rates in larger and highly developed cities are by nature slower than growth rates in smaller and less developed ones.</p><p>The geographic shift in employment and business growth cannot be explained by population trends alone. For example, roughly one-third of the counties that lost business establishments and one-quarter of the counties that lost jobs during the 2010s recovery actually saw an increase in population. Furthermore, populations increased in more than 20 percent of counties that lost both jobs and establishments.</p><p>Upward Mobility</p><p>While rumors of the demise of the American Dream have been greatly exaggerated, there are clear signs it is under threat or fenced off in too many American communities. Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, and their colleagues at the Equality of Opportunity Project (EOP) have done an enormous service through their research on upward mobility. Thanks to their work, as well as a flurry of other new research into economic mobility and geographic inequality, we understand better than ever just how profoundly geography impacts an individual’s economic destiny.</p><p>EIG recently merged EOP’s data on economic mobility with its own DCI data on economic wellbeing to examine the relationship between economic well-being and upward mobility in communities across the United States. 12 Specifically, we studied counties that fell into the top and bottom fifths of prosperity nationally. We find that county-level economic distress weighs more heavily on children from poor backgrounds than it does on children from wealthier ones, who are better equipped to rise above their surrounding circumstances. Troublingly, 60 percent of Americans under the age of 18 are growing up in counties that historically exert a negative impact on the economic mobility of low-income children.</p><p>Our analysis also finds a clear correlation between the degree of prosperity or distress in a county and the extent to which living there boosts or hinders a child’s future earnings potential. Prospering counties are generally more likely to foster upward mobility, although exceptions abound (especially in the Southeast). In fact, more than a quarter of the nation’s most prosperous counties fail to positively impact the future earnings potential of their poor children. Surprisingly, 10 percent of economically distressed counties still manage to promote upward mobility for poor children.</p><p>We also found an important silver lining for rural economies: Prosperous rural areas predominantly in the Upper Midwest and Northern Plains are the country’s most powerful engines of upward mobility.</p><p>Demographic Considerations</p><p>Recent U.S. demographic trends are exacerbating the decline of dynamism. <u>Population growth is a major driver of startup rates both nationally and regionally, so it should come as a concern that </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">the U.S. population grew by only 0.7 percent</u><u> in 2016</u> — the slowest since at least the Great Depression. 13 Meanwhile, <u>the median age in the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>has increased by nearly a decade since 1970</u>. <em style="background-color: yellow;">Immigration</em> into the United <em>States </em><em style="background-color: yellow;">is an obvious</em><em> dynamism </em><em style="background-color: yellow;">booster</em><em> on two fronts</em>. First, <u style="background-color: yellow;">it helps keep population growth in positive territory and bends the median age down</u>. Second, <u style="background-color: yellow;">immigrants</u> in the United States <u style="background-color: yellow;">are</u><u> highly entrepreneurial</u>; <u>research by the Kauffman Foundation found that immigrants were nearly twice as likely as U.S.-born individuals to start a business </u>in 2014. Not only that, but <em>they are </em><em style="background-color: yellow;">disproportionately likely to start high-growth companies</em>. A study last year found that more than half of the current crop of U.S.-based startups with a valuation of at least $1 billion were started by immigrants.</p><p><br></p><h4>Slow growth erodes interdependences, increases the likelihood of revisionism by Russia and China and risks great power war</h4><p><strong>Drezner, 16 </strong>– professor of international politics at Tufts and Senior Fellow at Brookings (Daniel, “Five Known Unknowns about the Next Generation Global Political Economy” May, http://www.anamnesis.info/sites/default/files/D_Drezner_2016.pdf</p><p><br></p><p>The erosion of the trade and demographic drivers puts even more pressure on technological innovation to be the engine of economic growth in the developed world. As one McKinsey analysis concluded, “<u>For economic growth to match its historical rates, virtually all of it must come </u><em>from increases in labor productivity</em>.”78 Growth in labor productivity is partially a function of capital investment, but mostly a function of technological innovation. The key question is whether the pace of technological innovation will sustain itself.</p><p>This remains a known unknown. The pace of innovation relative to global population has slowed dramatically over the past fifty years.79 Consider that the developed world still relies on the same general purpose technologies of modern society that were originally invented 50-100 years ago: the automobile, airplane, telephone, refrigerator, and computer. To be sure, all of these technologies have improved in recent decades, in some cases dramatically. But nothing new has replaced them. And even these improvements have not necessarily had dramatic systemic effects. For example, the average speed on a passenger aircraft has actually fallen since the introduction of the Boeing 707 in 1958, because of the need to conserve fuel. For all of the talk of “disruptive innovations,” the effect of these disruptions on both the business world and aggregate economic growth have been exaggerated.80</p><p>At present, many of the fields that seem promising for innovation—nanotechnology, green energy, and so forth—require massive fixed investments. Only large institutions, like research universities, multinational corporations and government entities, can play in that kind of game. Joseph Schumpeter warned that once large organizations became the primary engine of innovation, the pace of change would naturally slow down. Because large organizations are inherently bureaucratic and conservative, they will be less able to imagine radical innovations.81 What if the “secular stagnation” debate is really just a harbinger of a deeper debate about a return to pre-19th century growth levels?</p><p>An obvious counter to this argument is that the pace of technological innovation in laptops, smart phones, tablets, and the Internet of things has accelerated. This is undeniably true—but the problem is that the gains in utility have not been, strictly speaking, economic. Most of the important innovations that we think about with respect to the Internet—Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia, YouTube and so forth —are free technologies for consumers. As Tyler Cowen argues, “The big technological gains are coming in revenue-deficient sectors.”82 They generate lots of enjoyment but little employment. The largest and most dynamic information technology firms, like Google and Apple, hire only a fraction of the people who worked for General Motors in its heyday. At the same time, Internet-based content has eroded the financial viability of other parts of the economy. Content-providing sectors—such as music, entertainment, and journalism—have suffered directly. The growth of “sharing economy” firms like Uber and Airbnb that develop peer-to-peer markets are causing similar levels of creative disruption to the travel and tourism sectors.83 The rapid acceleration of automation is also leading to debates about whether the “lump of labor” fallacy remains a fallacy—in other words, whether displaced workers will be able to find new employment.84</p><p><u style="background-color: yellow;">A slow-growth</u><u> economic </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">trajectory</u><u> also creates policy problems that </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">increase the likelihood of even slower growth</u>. <u>Higher growth is a political palliative that makes structural reforms easier</u>. For example, Germany prides itself on the “Hartz reforms” to its labor markets last decade, and has advocated similar policies for the rest of the Eurozone since the start of the 2008 financial crisis. But the Hartz reforms were accomplished during a global economic upswing, boosting German exports and cushioning the shortterm cost of the reforms themselves. In a low-growth world, other economies will be understandably reluctant to engage in such reforms.</p><p>It is possible that concerns about a radical growth slowdown are exaggerated. In 1987, Robert Solow famously said, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.”85 A decade later, the late 1990s productivity surge was in full bloom. Economists are furiously debating whether the visible innovations in the information sector are leading to productivity advances that are simply going undetected in the current productivity statistics.86 Google’s chief economist Hal Varian, echoing Solow from a generation ago, asserts that “there is a lack of appreciation for what’s happening in Silicon Valley, because we don’t have a good way to measure it.”87 It is also possible that current innovations will only lead to gains in labor productivity a decade from now. The OECD argues that the productivity problem resides in firms far from the leading edge failing to adopt new technologies and systems.88 There are plenty of sectors, such as health or education, in which technological innovations can yield significant productivity gains. It would foolhardy to predict the end of radical innovations.</p><p>But the possibility of a technological slowdown is a significant “known unknown.” And <u style="background-color: yellow;">if such a slowdown occurs, it would have catastrophic effects on</u><u> the </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">public finances of</u><u> the OECD </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">economies</u>. Most of the developed world will have to support disproportionately large numbers of pensioners by 2036; <u style="background-color: yellow;">slower-growing economies will worsen the debt-to-GDP ratios</u> of most of these economies, <u>causing </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">further macroeconomic stresses</u><u>—</u><u style="background-color: yellow;">and</u>, potentially,<u> </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">political unrest</u><u> from increasingly stringent budget constraints</u>.89</p><h4>It risks nuclear conflict</h4><p><strong>Mann 14</strong> (Eric Mann is a special agent with a United States federal agency, with significant domestic and international counterintelligence and counter-terrorism experience.

So, the two figures can diverge for a long time… but not forever.</p><p>In the long run, aggregate stock prices cannot grow faster than Gross Domestic Product. Yes, some individual stocks can outperform for decades. But in total, they can’t, because their earnings are a function of the nation’s earnings (aka GDP).</p><p><u style="background-color: yellow;">GDP</u><u>,</u> in turn<u>, is the product of workers and productivity per worker.

The average woman now has 1.76 children—the replacement rate to keep a population stable is about 2.1.</p><p>But is that really news? In fact, this big drop occurred decades ago. Fertility fell by half between 1960 and 1976, from 3.65 down to 1.76. It’s gone relatively sideways since then.</p><p>In theory, lower fertility means fewer workers, which should reduce GDP unless productivity rises enough to offset it. But that didn’t happen. The opposite happened.</p><p>The rapid drop in fertility let millions of women move from unpaid motherhood, which doesn’t show up in GDP, to the paid work force. They became “productive” in ways the statistics can measure, and so GDP rose.</p><p>But that was largely a one-time event. By the 1990s, women were in the labor force at rates comparable to men. Our economy switched from expanding the workforce via new births to importing new workers.</p><p>Imported Workers Who Contributed to GDP Growth</p><p>Data shows that <u style="background-color: yellow;">net migration</u><u> to the U.S. </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">peaked in 1997</u>, when we gained 8.6 million new residents. That was the end of an uptrend that had started in the late 1980s. <u>It</u> also roughly <u style="background-color: yellow;">coincided with a period of strong</u><u> GDP </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">growth</u>.</p><p>Now consider what’s happened since 1997: measures of middle-class prosperity went flat or declined. GDP growth hasn’t exceeded 3% since 2005.</p><p>Other factors are at play too, but <u style="background-color: yellow;">if we’re not</u><u> sufficiently </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">expanding the workforce via</u><u> new births or </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">immigration, growth suffers</u><u>.

That helps, but not enough.</p><p><em style="background-color: yellow;">The only near-term answer is</em><em> more </em><em style="background-color: yellow;">immigration</em>.</p><p>I know that’s a touchy subject. Of course, we must control the borders, screen out criminals, etc. But <u>our economy needs workers, and millions are willing to work if we let them in.</u></p><p>Unfortunately, government policy is changing in the wrong direction.

Family-Based Immigrants and National Competitiveness</p><p><u>Kinship immigrants experience higher earnings growth than employment immigrants</u>, <u>with the earnings growth being particularly high in cohorts with high siblings’ admissions. The push to curtail family admissions,</u> however, <u>stems from a belief that employment-based immigrants improve national competitiveness whereas kinship immigrants do not.

Immigrant earnings patterns characterized by low initial earnings and high earnings growth are associated with high rates of schooling, training, and occupational change (Duleep and Regets 1999, 2002; Akresh 2007). That <strong><u>recent </u></strong><strong style="background-color: yellow;"><u>immigrants, who</u></strong><strong><u> mostly </u></strong><strong style="background-color: yellow;"><u>enter via kinship ties</u></strong><strong><u>, have higher earnings growth than U.S. natives means that recent immigrants </u></strong><strong style="background-color: yellow;"><u>are investing in new skills</u></strong><strong><u> (human capital) </u></strong><strong style="background-color: yellow;"><u>at higher rates than</u></strong><strong><u> U.S. </u></strong><strong style="background-color: yellow;"><u>natives</u></strong><strong><u>.</u></strong><u> That </u><strong><u>kinship immigrants have higher earnings growth than employment immigrants means that kinship immigrants are investing in new skills at higher rates than employment immigrants</u></strong><u>. </u><strong><u>Innovation</u></strong><u>, spurred in the U.S. by new and changing businesses, </u><strong><u>is the foundation of economic growth.</u></strong> <u>New and changing businesses require people who are willing and able to acquire new human capital</u>. <u style="background-color: yellow;">The most important attribute</u><u> that </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">immigrants can</u><u> bring </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">to insure the</u><u> </u><em>U.S. </em><em style="background-color: yellow;">economy’s long-run vitality</em><u style="background-color: yellow;"> is a propensity to learn new skills</u>, whether <u>in response to the needs of emerging or changing businesses, or by starting a new business</u>. Theoretically, because employment-based immigrants enter to fill specific jobs—and are paid accordingly—they have no more incentive than U.S. natives to invest in new human capital.13 <u>The low opportunity cost for a similarly educated kinship-based immigrant who could not initially transfer his homecountry human capital, paired with the value of this undervalued human capital for learning, makes pursuing further training an attractive option.

To examine the relationship between admission criteria and self-employment, we used the 1990 census-INS admissions data to measure correlations between the percent of each country-of-origin/year-of-entry cohort that was self-employed and, respectively, the percent admitted via occupational skills and the percent admitted via the siblings’ preference. No statistically significant correlation emerges between whether an immigrant is self-employed and the percent of his year-of-immigration/country-of-origin cohort admitted via occupational skills (Table 2). Yet, for all regions, <em style="background-color: yellow;">a</em><em> highly statistically </em><em style="background-color: yellow;">significant,</em><span style="background-color: yellow;"> </span><u style="background-color: yellow;">positive relationship exists between the propensity</u><u> of individual immigrants </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">to be self-employed and</u><u> the percent of their cohort admitted via </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">the siblings’ category</u>.</p><p>[Table 2 about here]</p><p>To further probe the relationship between admission criteria and immigrant selfemployment, we estimated the following model: P(SelfEmp)i= α+X’ß1+ß2YSM+γ1PerOccjk+γ2PerSibjk+εi where P(SelfEmp)i is the probability that immigrant i is self-employed, PerOcc jk is the percent of immigrants in group j and cohort k admitted through the employment-preference categories, PerSibjk is the percent of immigrants in group j and cohort k admitted through the siblingpreference category, YSM is years since migration, and the vector X includes age, age2, and seven education categories.15</p><p>Controlling for age, education, and years since migration, sibling admissions are negatively associated and employment admissions positively associated with the propensity to be self-employed for Europeans. However, <u>for the two largest immigrant groups, Asians and Hispanics, employment admissions have either a negative or statistically insignificant effect on the propensity to be self-employed whereas the siblings’ effect is positive and large</u>. Indeed, <u>its effect on self-employment overshadows any other variable in the analysis</u> (Table 3).</p><p>[Table 3 about here]</p><p>VI. Inadvertent Consequences of Removing Family-Admission Categories</p><p>The debate about admissions based on family versus skills is often presented as a dichotomy: Should the U.S. continue its primarily kinship-based policy or adopt a system that rewards needed skills? Yet skilled immigrants have families too. In considering which country to move to, will an emigrating scientist be more likely to choose a country where his family, including siblings, parents, and adult children, can also live, or a country where only certain family members are welcome? Since the mid-twentieth century, the United States has become much less dominant in science and technology—around two-thirds of global R&amp;D is now performed outside the United States. For today’s advanced degree holders, an international job search is normal, with career opportunities in multiple countries. In this setting, the openness of U.S. immigration policy affects the number and quality of the high-skilled workers we recruit.16 Currently, even U.S.- educated doctorate holders, who may have been in the U.S. for a decade, would need a new visa to take a U.S. job<u>. With job offers from multiple countries, the likelihood of obtaining visas for themselves and their family has to be an immediate part of their decision-making.

Incidentally, <u>the three leading countries of origin of family-based immigrants as listed in the 2015 U.S. Yearbook of Immigration Statistics by country of birth are Mexico (20.5% of all familybased immigrants to the U.S.), the Dominican Republic (7.4% of all familybased immigrants to the U.S.), and the Philippines (6.7% of all family-based immigrants to the U.S.) (U.S Office of Immigration Statistics, 2016, pp. 27- 30).</u> The prevalence of family immigration from these source countries also helps to explain why some Latino and Asian communities in the U.S. advocate for higher family immigration levels. </p><p>Here, it is important to fully consider what we mean by “skilled immigration,” and what “skills” are needed by U.S. employers. <u>First, </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">the common use of narrow</u><u> “low-skilled” and “high skilled” </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">worker classifications</u><u> in the labor economics literature </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">devalues the</u><u> capabilities and </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">on-the-job experience of many workers</u>. Further clarification about what separates these narrowly defined categories is rarely analyzed in any detail in the labor economics literature, although there are occasionally perfunctory discussions about educational attainment (i.e., a bachelor’s degree) and occupational status separating “high-skilled” and “low-skilled” workers (Card &amp; Peri, 2016, p. 4; Islam, Islam &amp; Nguyen, 2017, pp. 465, 481). <u>However, so-called </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">unskilled immigrants</u><u> who do not possess high levels of education </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">can be very productive in their area of specialization</u><u> based on their work experience, life skills, and occupational training</u> (Hagan, HernándezLeón &amp; Demonsant, 2015, pp. 9, 202-203). <u>A restaurant server or warehouse worker with substantial experience in their profession may be very proficient with practical skills that are difficult to replicate or replace by an employer or in a broader economic niche, </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">despite their lower levels of formal education</u> (Draut, 2016, pp. 43-46). 1 Thus, they are more accurately and humanely defined as mixed-skilled workers. </p><p><u>The term “unskilled worker” unfairly devalues the occupational experience and economic contributions of manual workers and service-sector laborers with a limited formal education.

In absence of Canadian job market experience, social capital, and acceptance of foreign credentials by employers, these “highly skilled” immigrants experience difficulties obtaining employment and contributing to economic growth in Canada (McMahon, 2013; LaRochelle-Côté &amp; Hango, 2016, pp. 2, 7) and unpaid kin caregivers – are providing to society at large. <u style="background-color: yellow;">Home-care providers perform essential services</u><u> on behalf of families </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">that allow more affluent</u><u>, educated “skilled” immigrants and </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">citizens to spend more time working and earning</u><u> outside the home</u> (Tronto, 2013, pp. 110-113; Poo, 2015, pp. 84-99). <u>Immigrant women who are working outside the home support the re-entry of female workers into the labor market following periods of parental leave, though their care work is not recognized as “highly skilled” for the purposes of immigration policy</u> (Boucher, 2016, pp. 28, 70). <u>Women who are sponsored as family-based immigrants are less likely to be employed in the paid workforce</u> (Sainsbury, 2016, p. 429). <u>Instead, </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">these</u><u> family-sponsored </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">immigrants occupy roles as caregivers for dependents in low-income</u><u> immigrant </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">families</u><u> who could not afford to hire an outside caregiver, </u><em style="background-color: yellow;">allowing other</em><em> family </em><em style="background-color: yellow;">members to work longer hours to support their households</em><em> and businesses </em>(Hyde, 2014, pp. 378-384; Boucher, 2016, p. 70). In short, <u>many “unskilled” immigrants – including family-sponsored immigrants – </u><em>play a necessary supporting role in increasing the productivity of citizen workers.</em> </p><p><u>The common presumption among those who want to replace family immigration preferences with skills or employment preferences is that “immigrants selected by job matching criteria are more likely to be successful than family immigrants”</u> (Jasso &amp; Rosenzweig, 1995, p. 86). In a series of studies from 1996 to 2014, Harriet Duleep and Mark Regets have found that family-based immigrants initially enter with lower educational levels, occupational status, and incomes than their employment-selected counterparts. <u>However, </u><em style="background-color: yellow;">kinship based immigrants experience higher skills</em><em> acquisition </em><em style="background-color: yellow;">and earnings growth</em><u style="background-color: yellow;"> than their employment-selected counterparts</u><u> within 10 years of entry</u> (Duleep &amp; Regets, 1996, p. 586; 2014, pp. 829-831). <u>One reason why family-based immigrants are able to increase their earnings and integrate into the U.S. labor market at a greater rate than their employment-selected counterparts is that </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">family-based immigrants are more likely to invest in human capital</u><u>, for instance, by hiring workers, than employment-selected immigrants who enter to perform a specific job with skills that may fall out of demand in a changing job market</u> (Duleep &amp; Regets, 2014, p. 832). Their U.S. citizen family members, who made a contract with the government to support the immigrants they sponsored, have a vested interest in their success over time (Gubernskaya &amp; Dreby, 2017, p. 424). <u>Unlike unrelated employers, </u><em style="background-color: yellow;">family members are less likely to simply hire and fire their sponsored immigrants</em><u> as market conditions dictate, and the enduring nature of this relationship of trust means that they are more likely to invest in their acquisition of U.S. specific skills</u> (Duleep &amp; Regets, 1996, p. 578; Duleep, 2015, pp. 138-139). <u>This finding in labor economics is supported by sociological research suggesting that family immigrants are able to rapidly acquire U.S. specific training and employment through close family social networks</u> (Waldinger &amp; Lichter, 2003; Hagan, Hernández-León &amp; Demonsant, 2015, pp. 91-97). </p><h4><u>Family reunification</u> through <u>kinship networks</u> is the vital internal link to sustained productivity gains</h4><p><strong>Sullivan 17 Michael Sullivan is an Associate Professor of Graduate International Relations with a focus on international migration and the ethics of immigration enforcement (Michael, “Defending Family Unity as an Immigration Policy Priority,” Studies in Social Justice, Volume 11, Issue 2, 369-388, 2017, ResearchGate) // SR</strong></p><p>With Legal Status, More Family Immigrants Can Build Businesses that Employ Citizens</p><p><u>Those who oppose prioritizing family unity in immigration policy contend that it burdens the country with a “surplus of low-skilled workers, increasing job competition and driving down wages and conditions to the detriment of American workers”</u> (Ruark, 2011, p. 1).

The basic idea is that as the number of migrants in a host country in period one grows, the level of remittances sent to the home country will increase in period two. Likewise, as the level of remittances received in the home country increases in period two, the level of migration to the host country will increase in period three. These phenomena could be summarized in a nutshell as "more migration, more remittances".</p><p>Although there is substantial evidence to prove that this dynamic is true, we will argue in this paper that <u>the relationship between migration and remittances is </u><em>not always positive and could be negative </em><u>depending on demographic, banking and immigration policies</u> that are seldom analyzed comprehensively by scholars or policy makers (some exceptions are Bauer and Sinning 2006, Cobb-Clark and Hildebrand 2002, Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2002).</p><p>We will present evidence to show that <u>an obvious factor molding the relationship between migration and remittances is </u><em>the demographic composition of the migratory flow</em>, which could be an unintended byproduct of immigration policies in host countries. <u>A migration flow of children and women, </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">following </u><em style="background-color: yellow;">family reunification</em><u style="background-color: yellow;"> policies</u><u>, </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">will</u><u> potentially </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">lead to a </u><em style="background-color: yellow;">significant reduction of both the supply and demand of remittances</em><span style="background-color: yellow;">.</span> As families reunify in the host country, <u>both the original and the new migrant will have </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">fewer relatives to send their remittances to.</u><u> This will result in </u>a counterintuitive dynamic:<u> more migration, but fewer remittances.</u></p><p><u>An additional phenomenon is the openness of the banking system to non-citizens </u>(including undocumented aliens) <u>in host countries.</u> This has a conflicting effect on remittances. On the one hand, the level of remittances received in the home country will increase as remitting costs from the host country decreases; this could be the case even if the level of remittances sent remains relatively constant. On the other hand, <u>as the banking system opens up for migrants, it also </u><em>becomes easier to save in the host country rather than to do so in the home country</em><u>.</u> This choice, along with family reunification, will transform remitters into savers.</p><p>In order to support our arguments we will analyze data from the Turkish and Polish migratory experience in Germany and from the case of Mexican migration to the United States.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we briefly discuss why people migrate and remit and we outline our argument. In Section II we present the opposing cases of Polish and Turkish migration to Germany, the former being a clear example of “more migration, more remittances” and the later an example of “more migration, fewer remittances”. In Section III we ask if the Turkish migratory pattern, and the fact that Turkish in Germany have evolved from remitters to savers, could be an effect that is starting to happen to Mexican migrants in the United States already. Finally Section IV explores some policy implications and concludes.</p><p>I - Why People Migrate and Remit?</p><p>Thousands of pages have been devoted to answer the very simple question: why do people migrate? There is no single satisfactory answer as it is evident to see that people migrate for many different reasons. In fact, the push and pull factors that motivate people to move from one place to another may vary by migratory system, depending on the circumstance people migrate for economic, political, and even environmental reasons. Push factors that prompt individuals to migrate include economic crisis, disparities in income and opportunities, political and religious persecution, natural disasters, and population pressures among others. Some of the factors that pull people out of their countries of origin may include higher wages, better job opportunities, religious and political liberties, better standard of living, etc.</p><p>In the literature we find a significant number of theories that study the migratory phenomenon from various perspectives such as neoclassical economics, segmented labor market theory, world systems, social capital, and cumulative causation (see Massey 1999 for a theoretical review). In this paper, however, we center our attention to the New Economics of Labor Migration (NELM) (Stark and Bloom 1985). This theory centers on the individual as unit of analysis. Here researchers are concerned with individual values and future expectations of migrants and potential migrants.</p><p>The particular focus of this theory is on how the migration decision process is made. According to NELM migration decisions are not made in a vacuum by isolated migrants, but are made within families or even communities in order to maximize their future income and to minimize their financial risks (Stark and Bloom 1985). The question that arises now is, how does NELM help us understand immigrant remitting behavior? Several studies have concentrated on the remitting behavior of the migrants who send money home (Banerjee 1984, Cortina and de la Garza 2004, Durand et al., 1996, Lucas and Stark 1985, Osaki 2003, Stark and Lucas 1988). <u>Immigrants remit for a wide number of reasons</u> that can be encompassed into at least two conceptual perspectives. <u style="background-color: yellow;">The first deals with remittances as inter-familial transfers for family maintenance and insurance</u> (Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2002, Durand 1996, Massey 1999, Lucas and Stark 1985). <u>These include transfers for basic consumption and asset accumulation</u>. The second considers remittances as particular and/or community-oriented investment in the home country (see Goldring 2004 for a comprehensive discussion).</p><p>In this paper we concentrate on the first conceptual category, that is, inter-familial transfers. In light of NELM migration theory, a common denominator that helps explain why immigrants send money home seems to be given by altruistic and non-altruistic reasons, which are sustained by an explicit or implicit contractual agreement between the migrant those family members left behind and sometimes between the migrant and her/his community of origin (Cortina and de la Garza 2004, Dustmann and Mestres 2007, Lucas and Stark 1985, Stark and Lucas 1988). Nonetheless, others have demonstrated that immigrants may also remit for “selfish”</p><p>In particular, <u>some studies have argued that </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">the most significant predictors that explain</u><u> </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">why</u><u> immigrants </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">remit are</u> two: 1) <u style="background-color: yellow;">having direct family members and/or children </u><em style="background-color: yellow;">living in the home country</em>; and, 2) having the expectation to return to the home country someday (Cortina, de la Garza and Ochoa-Reza 2005, Sana and Massey 2005). Somehow following this literature, others argue that altruism is going to be strongest in cohesive traditional families and weaker in nontraditional families with unstable bonds (Sana and Massey 2005).</p><p>In this section we have briefly discussed recent literature that attempts to describe the relationship between migration and remittances. We have argued <u>that once an individual has migrated, he or she has an implicit or explicit contract to send money home to those family members left behind.</u> Within this framework, we would expect that an increase in the number of migrants in period 1 would increase the amount remitted in period 2. <u>This relationship would be reinforced by the number of children and direct family members left behind.</u> In other words, as long as new migrants have direct family members and/or children left behind, the overall number of immigrants that will be sending money home will continue to increase. In short: more migration, more remittances.</p><p>The question that begs to be answered then is – <u>what happens once migrants’ family members are reunited with her/him in the host country</u>? Do immigrants continue to remit? If so, do they remit at the same rate? Some argue that given immigrant’s transnational behavior they will continue to send money back home even if they have settled (Gilick Schiller 1999, Guarnizo 2003). We will argue that the opposite is true. <u style="background-color: yellow;">Once family members that had been left behind are reunited in the host country</u><u>, </u><em>the contract by which migrants and family members left behind were obliged becomes obsolete</em> (Sana and Massey 2005). <em style="background-color: yellow;">Migrants then will stop remitting to the home country or at least will substantially decrease the frequency and amount sent home</em> (Sana 2003 for the Mexican case). This of course does not mean that migrants have reduced its level of income.

Although migrants face a life cycle of obligations to their home areas, these <u>obligations are likely to lose their immediacy, to compete with new obligations, and to be increasingly ignored</u>. It has also been argued that temporary migrants are able to remit more, partly because many of their expenses are met by permanent migrants, and partly because their temporary visas ensure that their return is imminent. It has been found that <u style="background-color: yellow;">migrants permanently overseas were under less pressure to remit</u><u> as their village commitments became less intense and less significant</u> (Shankman 1976, 59–60) <u>and they had also acquired financial commitments in their host country.</u> On the other hand, it has been suggested that the peculiarities of the “complex inter-relationships and social obligation patterns of the islanders” could imply a continuation of remittances by permanent migrants over the longer term, although at possibly lower levels (Australia 1989). </p><p>However, advocates of the remittance-decay hypothesis in the Pacific Islands have drawn support for their arguments mainly from studies of migrants in other countries.2 David Forsyth’s study for the Forum Secretariat postulated a remittance-decay function for the Pacific Islands based largely on evidence from an OECD study of remittance behavior in Europe (Forsyth 1992; OECD 1987). <u style="background-color: yellow;">The longer the duration of the migrants’ stay abroad, and the greater the associated decline in the number of dependents at “home,” the weaker the migrants’ motivations to remit</u><u> were assumed to become. </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">This</u>, it was conjectured, <u style="background-color: yellow;">explained the “remittance decay function</u><u>.”</u> According to Forsyth, <u>“sustained high rates of remittance tend to be characteristic of migrants who intend staying in the host [country] for a relatively brief period and then returning home. . . .

Alternatively, other studies have found little evidence of remittance decay. Guy Standing cited three studies of Indian migrants that revealed that the level of their remittances did not decline with time, but rather plateaued at some positive, constant level (1984).</p><h4>LPR status is key to reduce remittances</h4><p><strong>Amuedo-Dorantes, 10 </strong>– professor of economics at San Diego State University (Catalina, “Remittances to Latin America from migrants in the United States: Assessing the impact of amnesty programs” Journal of Development Economics</p><p>Volume 91, Issue 2, March 2010, Pages 323-335, Science Direct)</p><p><br></p><p>A variety of factors may affect the temporary versus long-lasting character of remittance flows, including changes in the composition and magnitude of migration flows, and changes in the characteristics of the existing migrant stock.

While the remittance literature has paid close attention to the motivation, uses, and the micro and macroeconomic effects of these money flows in the receiving economies, the impact of U.S. immigration policies on migrants' remitting patterns is an issue well understudied.</p><p>To start addressing this void in the literature, this paper provides an analysis of how legalization affects immigrants' propensity to remit money back home. In particular, we study how the generalized amnesty granted as part of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) affected immigrants' remitting patterns. By improving their labor outcomes, legalization may increase immigrants' disposable income and their ability to remit to their families and communities back home.

(Barajas et al., 2009)</p><p>There are several reasons for this pessimism about remittances transforming economies from poor to rich. The first is simple: the dramatic increase in global remittances and remittance flows may reflect better measurement rather than more money flowing to developing countries. Second, outmigration and remittances can keep entrenched elites in power and slow overall economic growth if the migration escape valve reduces pressure on governments to make the policy changes necessary for faster growth. The vice-president of Moldova, the poorest country in Eastern Europe, was quoted in 2004 as saying that if young and ambitious Moldovans could not migrate to Russia and Eastern Europe to work, they may protest at home and force a then-communist dominated government to change its policies. Talani (2014) makes a similar point about vicious circles in North Africa, where outmigration of the most able who cannot get ahead at home allows corrupt elites to remain in power and block the fundamental reforms necessary for sustainable growth.</p><p>Remittances can also be a two-edged sword in narrower economic terms. <u>Countries</u> such as Moldova <u>that send workers abroad need to develop other export industries to keep workers at home in the future</u>. However, <u style="background-color: yellow;">if remittances raise the value of the currencies of migrant-sending countries, exports can fall, displacing workers</u><u> in export-oriented sectors </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">and choking</u><u> off </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">their growth</u><span style="background-color: yellow;">. </span><u style="background-color: yellow;">This is an example of Dutch disease</u><u>: the rising value of the Dutch guilder after natural gas was discovered</u> in the North Sea in the 1950s <u>shrank the manufacturing sector and eliminated factory jobs</u>. <u>Many migrants are from countries with small export sectors, and the </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">remittances that benefit migrant families may</u><u> simultaneously </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">hurt other</u><u> families </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">whose jobs depend on exporting</u><u> manufacturing and agricultural </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">goods that become more expensive</u><u> as remittances drive up the value of the local currency </u>(Acosta et al., 2009; Atoyan etal., 2016: 21).</p><p><u style="background-color: yellow;">A shrinking export sector</u><u> and a higher share of the young and elderly among residents who depend on government programs </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">can mean less tax revenue</u> <u style="background-color: yellow;">and more demand for government services</u>. Governments must finance services for the elderly and children, and if they do so by raising taxes on ever fewer workers and their employers because many prime-aged workers are abroad, the economy's ability to produce goods and services competitively is reduced.</p><p>When a developing country produces workers for richer countries, the result can be a virtuous circle in which sending workers abroad in one period leads to stay-at-home development later, or a vicious circle in which <u>villages turn into nurseries for children and nursing homes for the elderly that depend on external lifelines.</u> There are examples of both virtuous and vicious circles between migration and development, suggesting skepticism when confront- ing assertions that migration speeds or slows development.</p><p><br></p><h4>Remittances create a <u>moral hazard</u> that undermines development – developing economies tend to spend less on education and health as inflow increases</h4><p><strong>Ebeke, 12</strong> – economist in the IMF's European Department with a focus on macroeconomic stability, international finance, fiscal policy, natural resources and international migration (Christian Ebeke, August 2012, "Do Remittances Lead to a Public Moral Hazard in Developing Countries?

Concluding Remarks</p><p>This article analyses the effect of remittances on public policies in countries affected by governance problems. I tested the hypothesis that governments of <u>badly governed </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">countries tend to reduce the level of</u><u> public </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">spending in social sectors</u><u> (education and health) </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">when</u><u> the level of </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">remittances increases</u><u>.</u> More generally, I argued that <u>remittances create a public moral hazard problem in those developing countries with governance problems.</u> <u>Using</u> a large cross-section of developing countries (<u>86 countries) observed over</u> the recent period <u>1996–2007</u>, and after <u>factoring in the endogeneity of remittances</u>, the potential effect of remittances on the demand for public services and the other sources of financing for the social sectors, the article concludes that the <u>remittance-induced fiscal retrenchment in social sectors takes place in developing countries with serious governance problems.</u></p><p>The article has illustrated how <u style="background-color: yellow;">remittances</u><u> combined with bad public governance might </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">induce a moral hazard problem</u><u> both </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">on government and households</u>. Indeed, <u>the negative effect of remittances on public spending on social sectors in institutionally vulnerable countries is the combination of two reinforcing effects: (i) public moral hazard – </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">because the government has more incentive to reduce and divert resources</u><u>, rather </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">than providing subsidies</u><u> since it thinks that remittances will do the ‘job’. (ii) household moral hazard – because remittances mollify the </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">recipient households</u><u> which </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">do not have the incentive to monitor the government</u><u> and so leave the cost of insurance to the migrant.</u></p><h4>Sustained growth in developing economies is vital to building resilience against food crises – 805 million are at risk</h4><p><strong>Soriano, 16</strong> – Technical University of Madrid, Spain (Barbara, “How important is economic growth for reducing undernourishment in developing countries?” Food Policy Volume 63, August 2016, Pages 87-101, Science Direct)</p><p><u>Despite the progress made in reducing hunger, </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">the international community continues to face</u><u> serious </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">challenges with regard to starvation</u><u> </u>and undernourishment. <u>FAO</u>, IFAD and WFP (2014) <u>estimated</u> that there about <u style="background-color: yellow;">805 million undernourished people</u> in 2012–14. Not all developing countries have experienced the same improvement rate in the prevalence of undernourishment. Analyzing a sample of 27 developing countries in the period from 1991 to 2011, we found that some achieved greater improvements in undernourishment at the beginning of the period, whereas others took longer to reduce the undernourishment rate, and the rate of improvement was stable in others.</p><p>The aim of the article was to show how economic growth helps to hasten improvements in the prevalence of undernourishment in developing countries. We combined the analysis of three characteristics of ec</p><p>onomic growth: rate, lag structure, and pathways through which economic growth leads to improvements in undernutrition. We<u> developed panel data models to estimate the impact of economic growth on the pace of improvements in the prevalence of undernourishment. The results of running the regression models on samples of countries grouped according to the undernourishment trend confirmed the findings of the regression models run on the whole sample</u>.</p><p>It is worth identifying some shortcomings that might have an impact on the findings. Concerning the dependent variable, we assume that: (1) the FAO undernourishment indicator appears to measure in a greater extent food availability than food intake; (2) the selection of the prevalence of undernourishment leaves out nutritional aspects measured by anthropometric indicators and the micro dimensions of food security; (3) the quality of the data used to build undernourishment indicator could be improved; and (4) the analysis only deals with improvements in undernourishment. It does not affect the main results because the differences of logarithms of the removed observations were very close to zero. Regarding the explanatory variables, our study is confined to some macro variables that affect long-term national food security. As a result, we do not consider the entire range of variables that might also affect food security. Finally, we omit many direct interventions that have proved essential for reducing undernourishment, such as micronutrient supplementation, food fortification or diet supplementation for pregnant women.</p><p>Despite the limitations of our study, the results support two main conclusions. The first conclusion is related to the rate, lag and term of economic growth and their impact on undernourishment. <u>We can conclude that </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">increased rates of</u><u> annual </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">economic growth lead to higher</u><u> annual </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">improvements in the nourished</u><u> </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">population</u>. <u>Taking into consideration income distribution, improvements in nourished population in countries with rising income and lower inequality are higher than in countries with rising income and higher inequality</u>. <u>Larger annual economic growth impacts lead to a faster improvement in undernourishment</u>. The economic growth lag analysis shows that it takes almost two years for annual income growth to lead to improvements in undernourishment. Thus, analyses of annual economic growth and the impact of longer term economic growth on undernourishment are both relevant. Long-term economic growth has a greater positive impact on undernourishment than short-term economic growth. <u style="background-color: yellow;">Sustained economic growth over three to eight years results in greater improvements in undernourishment rates.</u></p><p>The second conclusion refers to the structure of economic growth. <u>In addition to economic growth, other enabling factors, like investments in health, education and access to drinking water, help to reduce the prevalence of undernourishment. </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">The indirect impact of</u><u> economic </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">growth as an enabler of investment in</u><u> these key factors of </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">food security accounts for</u><u> close to </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">50% of the total impact</u><u> economic growth</u> on undernourishment. <em style="background-color: yellow;">Even if economic growth falters</em><span style="background-color: yellow;">, </span><u style="background-color: yellow;">sustained improvements</u><u> in health, education and access to drinking water </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">may still drive reductions in</u><u> the percentage of </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">undernourished people</u><span style="background-color: yellow;">.</span></p><p><br></p><h4>Food crises are <u>inevitable</u> in low-income countries – building resilience is key</h4><p><strong>Adadeji, 16 </strong>- Olumuyiwa Adedeji currently works at the Middle East and Central Asia Department, International Monetary Fund.

In addition, <u>their economies are generally less diversified, thereby reducing post-shock economic resilience</u> (Laframboise and Loko, 2012).3 At a micro level, <u>natural disasters are likely to have a higher impact on the poorest</u>, given their limited capacity to respond (e.g., via savings and access to credit—see Hallegate and Przyluski, 2010).</p><p><u>LICs’ exposure to natural disasters </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">can have a significant impact on</u><u> food production and </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">food crisis</u><u>,</u> the focus of the current paper. Nearly a quarter of damages wrought by natural disasters on LICs are borne by the agricultural sector (FAO, 2015). In this connection, an understanding of the interplay between the occurrence and the impact of natural disaster on food crises and how the availability of macroeconomic buffers could help to mitigate the impact of such shocks is important. Nonetheless, there has been limited analysis on the role that strong macroeconomic position could potentially play in reducing the vulnerability of LICs to a food crisis. <u>Natural disasters tend to affect domestic production of food and could potentially lead to food crises in the absence of strong macroeconomic positions</u>. <u style="background-color: yellow;">Large scale</u><u> natural </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">disasters</u><u> often </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">disrupt, if not destroy</u><u> domestic </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">production</u><u>.</u> They tend to not only reduce short-term domestic food production, but pose a major risk to future production. <u>Reduced domestic production could be supplemented by imports </u><em>in the presence of strong external and fiscal positions</em>, thereby avoiding food crisis. <u style="background-color: yellow;">While external food assistance could be important</u><u>, such as the world food program, </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">it has turned out to be insufficient</u><u> in the context of significant natural disasters</u>. In addition, to protect the poor from the high food prices, occasioned by natural disasters or global developments, <u>governments had adopted a variety of fiscal instrument such as higher subsidies, lower food taxes and tariffs, and scaledup public transfers</u>. <u>The ability of a government to carry out such policy measures would reflect pre-existing fiscal position</u>. In this connection, this paper aims to answer the following specific questions: (i) do natural disasters matter for food crises? and (ii) could strong macroeconomic conditions help to limit the occurrence of natural disasters from evolving into food crises?</p><p>A number of existing studies provide the analytical basis for the current paper. Food crisis is perceived in the literature as the probability of an acute decline in food access or consumption often in reference to some critical value. 4 The ensuing vulnerability depends on exposure to shocks and underlying socio-economic variables (Chambers (1989) and Riely (2000)). Similar to the concept of a growth crisis (see Dabla-Norris and Bal Gündüz (2012 and 2014)),5 the current paper places emphasis on severe decline in food availability on the basis of which a food crisis episode is identified. Our measures of food availability encompasses the “total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted for any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period.6</p><p>Multivariate regression analysis and a univariate ‘signaling’ approach are used to map information from the underlying indicators to form a composite food crisis index. The former method adopts a correlated probit model to determine the probability of a food crisis, which allows correlations among variables, to determine the significance of individual variable, and to ascertain the constancy of coefficients across country groups. The univariate signaling approach involves the use of each indicator to determine food crises separately, thereby identifying thresholds that signal such events with the lowest prediction error, and then averaging the indicators in a summary index. These two approaches are complementary, as the results from the probit analysis guide the selection of variables used in the univariate approach.</p><p>This paper develops a food crisis index (FCI) to assess the vulnerability of LICs to food crisis due to the occurrence of natural disasters, focusing on macroeconomic (mainly external and fiscal indicators) and institutional indicators. Results show that the probability of experiencing a food crisis increases for countries with weaker institutions and low food production fundamentals measured by food supply per capita growth trend. <u style="background-color: yellow;">Sound policy fundamentals such as low fiscal deficit</u><u> and high reserve coverage </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">are linked to a lower likelihood of food crisis</u>. The constructed index can be used to assess vulnerabilities to food crisis in LICs over time.</p><p><br></p><h4>Food insecurity causes war</h4><p><strong>Koren, University of Minnesota Political Science PhD Candidate, &amp; Bagozzi, Delaware University Political Science Assistant Professor, 16</strong></p><p>[Ore Koren is a PhD candidate at the University of Minnesota in Political Science and a former Jennings Randolph Fellow at the United States Institute of Peace.

From the demand side, <u style="background-color: yellow;">violent conflict </u><u>is </u><strong><u>most likely</u></strong><u> to </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">revolve</u><u> primarily </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">around access to food sources</u><span style="background-color: yellow;">.</span> <u>When food insecurity produces higher demands for </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">food</u><u>,</u> <u>these </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">demands will </u><strong style="background-color: yellow;"><u>directly compel</u></strong><u style="background-color: yellow;"> groups and individuals to seek out and fight</u><u> over existing food resources</u>, rather than leading these actors to pursue and fight over geographic areas that lack any (or have very little) agricultural resources. Thus, access to croplands and food is a necessary condition for food insecurity-induced conflict, which is confirmed in the cropland analyses presented here. From the supply side, and within those areas that do already offer access to agriculture and/or food, conflict is most likely to occur in regions that offer lower levels of food availability, or insufficient food supplies. This is because lower food availability (or supplies) in these contexts directly implies higher levels of <u>resource scarcity</u>, which <u>can engender social grievances</u>, <u>and</u> ultimately, <u>social and political conflict</u> (Brinkman and Hendrix 2011; Hendrix and Brinkman 2013). More broadly, <strong><u>several causal mechanisms</u></strong><u> could plausibly link food security and social conflict.</u></p><p>For one, <u style="background-color: yellow;">conflict in regions with higher food access and lower availability might arise as a principal outcome of food insecurity</u>. This approach is most directly in tune with the body of research concerned with the resource scarcity-based security implications of climate change (e.g. Miguel et al. 2004; Burke et al. 2009; O’Loughlin et al. 2012), as well as with broader studies of conflict dynamics and food security in both rural and urban contexts (Brinkman and Hendrix 2011; Hendrix and Brinkman 2013; Messer and Cohen 2006). From this perspective, <u>individuals and groups actively fight with one another due to food insecurity-induced grievances</u>, <u>which may manifest in </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">groups’ attempts to </u><strong style="background-color: yellow;"><u>overthrow existing political structures</u></strong><span style="background-color: yellow;">,</span> <u>or</u> in these actors’ efforts to more <u>directly seize and control available</u> (but scarce) <u>agricultural resources</u> in an effort to better guarantee long-term food security for their constituents. If future global projections for population growth, consumption, and climate change hold true, then these dynamics suggest that <strong style="background-color: yellow;"><u>incidences of violent conflict over food scarcity and food insecurity may increase</u></strong><u> as individuals and groups fight over a continuously shrinking pool of</u> resources, including <u>food</u>.</p><p>A second mechanism involves the existence of logistic support in conflict-prone regions, or lack thereof. <u>Throughout history</u> and well into the nineteenth century, <u>armies living off the land have been a regular characteristic of warfare</u>. The utilization of motorized transport vehicles and airlifts has significantly reduced the need of modern militaries to rely on local populations for support, at least among modernized, highly technological militaries (Kress 2002, 12–13). However, given the bureaucratic and economic capabilities required to maintain such systems, <u>the majority of </u><strong><u>state and non-state armed groups</u></strong><u> in the developing world are still unlikely to be supported by well-developed logistic supply chains</u> (Henk and Rupiya 2001). Taking into account the consistent relationship between economic welfare and conflict (Hegre and Sambanis 2006; Fearon and Laitin 2003), <strong style="background-color: yellow;"><u>unsupported warring groups</u></strong><u style="background-color: yellow;"> on all sides of a conflict may </u><strong style="background-color: yellow;"><u>move into regions that offer more access to cropland</u></strong><u> in order to forage and pillage to support themselves</u>, <u>which in turn produces </u><strong><u>higher incidences of hostilities</u></strong>, especially if there is not much food per person available within these fertile regions. Hence, violent conflict in this case is not the direct result of food insecurity, but rather is shaped by food insecurity concerns.</p><p><u>The identified relationships between food security and conflict are </u><strong><u>robust across numerous alternative model specifications</u></strong>, <u>and imply an </u><strong><u>independent effect</u></strong><u> of food insecurity in shaping conflict dynamics and conflict risk</u>. Especially when considered alongside current, and projected, climatic and political-economic conditions, this linkage suggests that countries could see an increase in localized conflict worldwide in the coming years. However, this anticipated trend should be considered with caution for several key reasons.</p><p><br></p><h4>Food insecurity causes <u>nuclear war</u></h4><p><strong>Cribb 14</strong> – Canberra science writer, author of “Poisoned Planet, Allen &amp; Unwin”, and journalist for the Sydney Morning Herald (Julian, “Human extinction: it is possible?” Sydney Morning Herald, April 2, 2014, http://www.smh.com.au/comment/human-extinction-it-is-possible-20140402-zqpln.html)//RCU</p><p>However our own behaviour is liable to be a far more immediate determinant of human survival or extinction. Above two degrees – which we have already locked in – <u>the world’s </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">food</u><u> harvest </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">is going to become increasingly unreliable</u>, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned this week<u>. </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">That means</u><u> mid-century </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">famines in</u><u> places like </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">India, China, the Middle East and Africa</u>. But what scientists cannot predict is how humans living in the tropics and subtropics will respond to this form of stress. So let us turn to the strategic and military think tanks, who like to explore such scenarios, instead. The Age of Consequences study by <u style="background-color: yellow;">the US Centre for Strategic</u><u> and International </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">Studies says that</u> under a 2.6 degree rise “nations around the world will be overwhelmed by the scale of change and pernicious challenges, such as pandemic disease. <u style="background-color: yellow;">The internal cohesion of nations will be under great stress</u><u>…as a result of a dramatic rise in migration and changes in agricultural patterns and water availability.

At the same time, with more than 4 billion people living in the world’s most vulnerable regions, scope for refugee tsunamis and pandemic disease is also large. It is on the basis of scenarios such as these that scientists like Peter Schellnhuber – science advisor to German President Angela Merkel – and Canadian author Gwynne Dyer have warned of the potential loss of most of the human population in the conflicts, famines and pandemics spinning out of climate impacts. Whether that adds up to extinction or not rather depends on how many of the world’s 20,000 nukes are let off in the process. These issues all involve assumptions about human, national and religious behaviour and are thus beyond the remit of scientific bodies like the IPCC, which can only hint at what they truly think will happen. So you are not getting the full picture from them. </p><h4>Intensifying food insecurity in developing economies risks nuclear conflict and makes pandemics more likely</h4><p><strong>Denkenberger, 16 – </strong>Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, Calabasas; Department of Civil and Architectural EngineeringTennessee State University (David, “Cost-Effectiveness of Interventions for Alternate Food to Address Agricultural Catastrophes Globally” International Journal of Disaster Risk Science, September, Springer)</p><p>The uncertainty in the number of fatalities due to a 10 % agricultural shortfall is very large. On the optimistic extreme, there could be aggressive government support or charity such that the vast majority of the global poor could generally afford sufficient food. If the crisis were only a year or two, loans could be feasible, either to poor individuals or poor countries. The necessary conservation (less waste, less food to animals, and so on) in the developed countries could be achieved by higher prices or rationing. However, <u style="background-color: yellow;">even if mass starvation is averted</u><u>, generally </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">there would be more</u><u> malnutrition and increasing </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">susceptibility to disease</u><u>.

Even if food aid is available, it may not be possible to get the food to the people who need it. Therefore, near zero mortality is unlikely. At the same time, <u style="background-color: yellow;">even with no catastrophe, 6.5 million people die of hunger-related diseases per year</u> (UNICEF 2006). On the other extreme, there could be food export restrictions or bans, as implemented by India, Vietnam, Egypt, and China in 2008 (Helfand 2013) when the situation was much less serious. This hoarding on a country level could also be coupled with hoarding on an individual level. This could dramatically reduce the food supply available to poor people.</p><p><u style="background-color: yellow;">Armed conflict</u><u> could be in some countries’ best interest, which could also aggravate famine</u> (Keller 1992; Waldman 2001; Goodhand 2003). <em>These wars </em><em style="background-color: yellow;">could even evolve into nuclear conflict</em>, which would further impact food supplies. One estimate of <u style="background-color: yellow;">the number of people at risk of starvation due to regional</u><u> nuclear </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">conflict is 2 billion</u><u> </u>(Helfand 2013). To capture this very large variation in behavior, a gamma function was used with a 95 % credible interval of about 20 million to 2 billion fatalities, with a median of 400 million.3 Figure 2 shows cumulative probability, so the vertical axis values of 0.025 and 0.975 bound the range. <u>There are currently 870 million people who are chronically malnourished</u> (Helfand 2013). <u>These people could quickly starve if there were a significant price increase</u> (urban) <u>or a significant reduction in farm output</u> (rural). However, once 400 million people have starved to death (6 % of the current global total population), this would free up significant food for the remaining people. Therefore, 400 million people starving to death is used as the median (vertical axis value of 0.5 in Fig. 2). This distribution also includes the uncertainty in the duration of the shortfall which would run from 1 year for extreme weather to more than 10 years for nuclear war (Özdoğan et al. 2013). The uncertainty also captures the variation in the scope of the shortfall—it could be fairly uniform globally or concentrated in either developed or developing countries. If there are large regional imbalances, shipping would be adequate technically (Denkenberger and Pearce 2014), but there would be economic and political difficulties.</p><p><br></p><h4>Pandemics risk extinction</h4><p><strong>Warwick 16</strong></p><p>[Mal Warwick, member of the National Book Critics Circle and the Northern California Book Reviewers, judge for General Nonfiction for the 35th Annual Northern California Book Awards.

But they have nothing to do with immigration, terrorism, or hunting rifles. <em>Any logical, clear-headed look at the world around us reveals that the true existential threats on the horizon include</em> <u>climate change, nuclear holocaust,</u> <em>pandemics</em>, and, at a higher level of logical abstraction, rampant consumerism. However, <em style="background-color: yellow;">the most immediate of</em><em> these </em><em style="background-color: yellow;">threats to our civilization appears to be contagious disease</em><em>.</em> In Pandemic, Sonia <u>Shah’s superb survey of the past, present, and future of infectious disease</u>. Just so it’s clear: she’s <u>not</u> writing about <u>simple colds and mild flus, but </u>about <em style="background-color: yellow;">illnesses</em><em> that </em><em style="background-color: yellow;">might kill tens or hundreds of millions of people with little warning and with unpredictable consequences</em><em> for the cohesion of society.</em> The heart of the problem, as she explains, is that <u>“</u><u style="background-color: yellow;">epidemics grow exponentially while our ability to respond proceeds linearly</u><u>, at best.”</u> A balanced view of contagious disease Thanks to alarmist reporting, Americans are terrified that hemorrhagic diseases such as Ebola will “break out” and kill us by the millions. Shah patiently explains that much more <em style="background-color: yellow;">common diseases</em><em> are</em> far more <em>likely to pose threats to us, </em><u>influenza and cholera in particular.</u> A series of <u>unfortunate mutations</u> in either one <u>could fashion a disease that </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">is not just virulent</u> (contagious) <u style="background-color: yellow;">but also highly lethal</u><u>.</u> Today, for example, influenza kills only a small proportion of its victims. We tend to regard it more as a nuisance for most of us, a threat only to those who are most vulnerable. However, the “Spanish flu” (the <u style="background-color: yellow;">H1N1</u> virus) that broke out in the final days of World War I <u>infected up to 500 million people (between a fifth and a third of the world’s population) and </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">killed</u><u> between 50 and </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">100 million.</u><span style="background-color: yellow;"> </span><em style="background-color: yellow;">Epidemiologists live in fear</em><span style="background-color: yellow;"> </span><u style="background-color: yellow;">that</u><u> H1N1 or one of the countless other </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">varieties of influenza</u><u> incubating in Southern China </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">could put on a repeat performance</u><u> — or worse. Cholera poses a similar threat.</u> Sanitation, Hippocratic medicine, and Christianity One of the most fascinating passages in Pandemic is Shah’s account of the role of Christianity in fostering infectious disease for more than a thousand years. History shows us that two thousand years ago the Romans piped clean drinking water to their cities through an elaborate system of aqueducts and made public baths available to one and all. Cleanliness was a virtue to them. That all began to change with the advent of Christianity a few centuries into the Common Era. Unlike the Jews and (later) the Muslims, Christian clergy disdained personal hygiene, associating it with Roman polytheism and viewing cleanliness as superstitious. It was common for Catholic priests and the Protestant pastors who succeeded them in some parts to discourage their flocks from bathing. For many centuries, the vast majority of people in Christian lands lived side-by-side with their animals atop pits filled with excrement and cooked with smelly water drawn from contaminated streams or wells. When disease struck, as it did with increasing frequency as population grew and gravitated toward the cities, the physicians who purported to combat it were in the thrall of the Hippocratic school of medicine, which attributed all disease to an imbalance in the four “humors” within the body and in external factors that exacerbated it. For example, cholera, which sickened hundreds of millions through the centuries and killed half of them, was blamed on the inhalation of what the ancient physician Galen termed “miasmas” (offensive smells). The nineteenth-century physicians who practiced medical “science” based on these beliefs “increased [cholera’s] death toll from 50 to 70 percent.” <u>Though the germ theory of disease was first proposed in the sixteenth century, it wasn’t until three centuries later, on the cusp of the twentieth century, that practicing physicians began to accept the role of microorganisms in causing disease.</u> Meanwhile, progress toward improved sanitation and the availability of clean drinking water was even slower. As Shah explains in chilling detail, the construction of London’s sewer system was not prompted because public health officials understood that water used for drinking and washing was dangerously contaminated. The reason they proposed the effort was that they thought it was essential to pipe all the smelly sewage into the Thames, the source of the city’s drinking water! Only in the twentieth century did it become common for municipalities to regard drinkable water as a necessity of life. <em>Why is contagious disease more of a threat today than ever before?</em> In Pandemic, Shah describes the role of <u style="background-color: yellow;">contemporary trends</u> in <u style="background-color: yellow;">making the threat</u><u> of epidemic disease </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">greater than ever</u><u>.</u> Five stand out: <u>climate change, continuing urbanization, ever more accessible global transportation, resistance to vaccines, and the encroachment of development </u>on previously virgin lands, especially <u>in sub-Saharan Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and the Amazon. </u>The result is that <em style="background-color: yellow;">an increasing number of</em><em> unknown and </em><em style="background-color: yellow;">unpredictable</em><em> new tropical </em><em style="background-color: yellow;">diseases is emerging and making their way into more</em><em> and more </em><em style="background-color: yellow;">crowded cities</em><em> further and further</em> north <em style="background-color: yellow;">on the globe</em><em>.</em> <u>All the while, diseases previously thought conquered, such as polio and measles, rise up in communities around the globe.</u> About the author The daughter of Indian immigrants, Sonia <u>Shah is an American investigative journalist who has reported from around the world, principally on corporate power and gender inequality. Pandemic is her sixth book.</u> Though <u>her parents are both physicians and she lives with a molecular biologist, </u>it appears that the impetus for writing this book came from a painful personal experience with MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), which she contracted from her son. Shah describes her eye-opening experience at length in Pandemic.</p><h3>Plan</h3><h4>The United States federal government should reduce numerical restrictions from family-based immigration preferences sufficiently to end backlogs in those preferences, and adopt a ‘known and emotionally important to’ standard for determining what constitutes a family-based relationship in immigration law.</h4><p><br></p><h3>Solvency </h3><h4>The plan’s weakening of numerical restrictions solves backlogs and boosts productivity</h4><p><strong>National Immigration Forum, 12 </strong>(“Immigration Backlogs are Separating American Families” 7/26, https://immigrationforum.org/article/immigration-backlogs-separating-american-families/</p><p><br></p><p>Our family immigration system places people who want to immigrate to the U.S. into visa categories (most with numerical limits) according to the closeness of the relationship and the citizenship status of the U.S. family member.</p><p>As the table above shows, there is no numerical cap for spouses, unmarried minor children, and parents of U.S. citizens. This category is called “immediate relatives of U.S. citizens.” For all other relations, however, there are strict limits on the total number in each category. All “immediate relatives” plus all of the family preference categories must fit within an overall ceiling for family-based immigration of 480,000, but this ceiling can be exceeded due to the fact that there is a “floor” of 226,000 for the family preference categories (non-immediate relatives) coupled with the fact that immediate relatives are not capped. (So, when immediate relative immigration is more than 254,000 (480,000 – 226,000), the overall ceiling is “pierced.”) For many years now, there have been no more than 226,000 visas allocated to the family preference categories because immediate relative immigration has been more than 254,000 per year. This is the heart of the backlog problem with family preference immigration.</p><p>In addition to these category limits, the ceiling on the number of people we allow in from any one country is approximately 25,600. This ceiling includes immigrants in the family-preference categories and immigrants who are coming here through the sponsorship of an employer. There are some exceptions to the per-country limits, including an exemption from per-country limits for three-quarters of the visas allocated to the spouses and children of legal permanent residents (the family 2A preference).[1]</p><p>Two kinds of backlogs</p><p>There are two kinds of backlogs. At the end of the immigration process, when an immigrant visa is available to the immigrant, there may be an administrative backlog due to the fact that the immigration service may not have sufficient resources to handle its workload. These backlogs can be dealt with by giving the immigration agency more resources to handle its workload.</p><p>However, <u>the more serious problem</u>—often confused with the administrative problem—<u>is the much </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">longer backlog that has developed because the number of visas available</u><u> by law each year is less than the number of prospective immigrants getting in line to wait for a visa</u>. T<u>his problem cannot be solved by making the immigration agency more efficient, but will only be resolved by reforming our immigration system so that the number of visas available better meets demand.</u></p><p>Priority dates and backlogs</p><p>An immigrant begins the process of joining his or her family member in the U.S. when the family member submits a petition to the government. The filing of that petition establishes a priority date, holding the immigrant’s place in line. The State Department keeps tabs on whether or not there are visas available within the category and per-country limits. If there is no backlog, an immigrant visa (or “green card”) is immediately available to the immigrant, and the immigrant will receive one as soon as the government processes the application. In the application process, checks are performed to make sure the individual has no criminal history, is not a security threat, and is otherwise not inadmissible as an immigrant to the U.S.</p><p>In recent years, however, <u>the number of </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">visas</u><u> </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">available</u><u> in our family immigration system ha</u><u style="background-color: yellow;">s not met the demand</u>. Except for the spouses, children, and parents of U.S. citizens, for which there are no per-country or category ceilings, <u>there are </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">backlogs in all categories of family-based immigration</u>[2]. Each month, the State Department publishes a table showing the availability of immigrant visas relative to their priority dates. The “Visa Bulletin,” in which this table is published, can be found on the Web site of the State Department at:</p><p>http://www.travel.state.gov/visa/bulletin/bulletin_1360.html.</p><p>As of November 2011 (according to the most recent State Department report on the number of persons waiting for an immigrant visa), there were more than 300,000 wives, husbands and children of legal permanent residents waiting for immigrant visas[3]. By August 2012, these immigrants were only now receiving a visa if their priority date was earlier than March 15, 2010—that is, after a wait of almost two and a half years. A U.S. citizen who petitioned for a sibling is only now being rejoined with that sister or brother after a wait of 11 years and six months. Compared to the number of visas available each year, the category of siblings of U.S. citizens has the largest backlog. As of November 2011, there were more than 2.5 million siblings waiting for the 65,000 visas available each year.[4]</p><p>The current projections of the backlogs that appear in the Visa Bulletin may actually understate the wait an immigrant will eventually have. For reasons having to do with the ability of the government to keep up with the demand for “adjustment of status” cases, the “current” priority date may actually go backwards from one month to the next. For example, in January 2011 the priority date for which visas were being allocated for the category of siblings of U.S. citizens was January 1, 2002. By February 2011, the priority date had actually receded to January 1, 2000.</p><p>Given that we have already decided, in the structure of our immigration law, to make family unity a priority, it does not make sense to have an outdated quota system that keeps families separated for many years. If we as a nation continue to believe that it is important to keep families together, then we must reform our immigration system so that the category and per-country limits that we now have on family-based immigration meet our needs.</p><p>Current law regarding family unification should be updated</p><p>The emphasis we place in our immigration law on the reunification of families makes sense in terms of helping our newcomers adapt to their new home. <u>Family members help each other adjust to their new surroundings by pooling resources and sharing responsibilities</u> (for example, for the care of children or elderly parents).</p><p><u style="background-color: yellow;">The inability to bring family members makes it harder for U.S. companies to attract the workers they need.</u><u> Workers who do come may be less productive if forced to endure a long separation from their families</u>. Additionally, immigrants coming to the U.S. as a result of family ties also get jobs and become valuable contributors to our economy. Finally, strong families help stabilize communities.</p><p>As the backlogs grow, more families are facing the choice of remaining separated for several years or keeping the family intact by having some members enter illegally. The backlogs are also yielding consequences contrary to some of our other policy goals. For Filipinos, for example, becoming a U.S. citizen may mean a longer separation from adult children. The backlog for the adult children of Filipinos who become citizens is longer than the wait to bring in adult unmarried children of permanent residents. As a practical matter, reuniting with family in this case may mean postponing citizenship.</p><p>Immigration reform is needed to speed the reunification of families</p><p>Changes to the family preference system are needed so that families might be re-united in a timelier manner. <u>Updating our family immigration laws will reduce the pressure for family members to migrate outside of legal channels.</u> By creating wider legal channels for immigrants to come here, the number of people who come illegally will be reduced or eliminated.</p><p>There are a number of things <u>Congress could</u> do to <u>alleviate the backlogs</u> and their consequences.</p><p>Update the immigrant quota system: Our immigrant quota system has not been updated in more than two decades, despite increased demand. There are several ways that Congress could reform the system. “<u style="background-color: yellow;">Immediate relatives” could be exempted from the family-sponsored immigrant</u><u> </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">cap</u><u> 480,000, so that the cap would apply only to preference immigrants</u>. <u style="background-color: yellow;">The definition of immediate relative might be expanded to include the spouses and minor children of legal permanent residents</u><u>. This would free up visas in the limited family preference system so they could be re-allocated to the remaining categories</u> of family-sponsored immigrants. <u>With these extra visas, there would be much progress in reducing the long backlog</u> now experienced by these categories of immigrants.</p><p>Place a cap on the backlog: Congress could provide for waivers to the per-country and world-wide numerical limits to family reunification that would be triggered when an immigrant’s wait exceeded a period of time—five years, for example. Any eligible family-sponsored immigrant who had waited five years or more would be given a visa whether or not that year’s quotas had been reached.</p><p>Re-allocate unused visas from the prior year: Even though there is more demand for visas than there are available visas, it sometimes happens (usually, because of processing delays or security screening) that some of the visas that should be allocated in a given year are not allocated. If not allocated, the visas are not used. Congress could change the law so that when processing delays result in unused visas, those unused visas are made available the following year, outside of the current year’s per country or quota limits. Going back and re-capturing unused visas would have a significant impact on backlogs. According to the USCIS Ombudsman, between 1992 and 2009, there were nearly 242,000 visas in the family preference system that went unused.[5].</p><h4>A narrow definition of family makes family-based immigration <u>incredibly difficult</u> – exclusionary and lack of refugee provisions</h4><p><strong>King 09 Shani M. King is a Professor of Law and Director of the law school’s Center on Children and Families (Shani M. “U.S. Immigration Law and the Traditional Nuclear Conception of Family: Toward a Functional Definition of Family that Protects Children's Fundamental Human Rights,” Columbia Human Rights Review, 10/1/09) // SR </strong></p><p>A. US Immigration Law’s Narrow Definition of Family</p><p>1. Family&amp;Based Immigration</p><p><u>While the INA has long promoted the notion of family unity in certain circumstances,51 the statutory preference for a conception of family that reflects the traditional nuclear family is clear and unambiguous. In essence, the conception of family unity reflected in the </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">INA is grounded in the concept which fails to reflect the familial formations of many children affected by U.S. immigration laws</u>.52</p><p>The INA’s selection system does not treat all family members alike. As one author has explained:</p><p><u>Recognized relationships closely track westernized notions of family and generally only encompass first&amp;degree relatives_ unformalized relationships (de facto or long term cohabitation) are not recognized. Relationships considered contrary to public policy, such as bigamous or close&amp;degree relative marriages, as well as same&amp;sex relationships, will generally not provide the basis for benefits</u>.53</p><p><u style="background-color: yellow;">Those </u><u>relatives </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">eligible to immigrate through a family petition are divided into two </u><u>main </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">categories. </u><u>Both categories are made up of </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">first&amp;degree relatives and would be considered “immediate”</u><u> family members by those who recognize this concept. The first category includes only “immediate relatives” of US Citizens:&nbsp;parents, spouses, and unmarried children under the age of twenty&amp;one.55 </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">The second category includes “preference</u><u>” immigrants: unmarried children of United States citizens (who are over twenty&amp;one at the time the petition is filed), spouses and unmarried children under twenty&amp;one of permanent residents, unmarried children over twenty&amp; one of permanent residents, married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens, and brothers and sisters of United States citizens where the petitioner is at least twenty&amp;one years old when the petition is filed.57 </u></p><p><u>While both “immediate” and “preferred relatives are permitted entry to the United States due to their status as family members, immediate relatives are given priority over “preferred” relatives, who may have to wait months or years before immigrating.58 The immediate relatives can immigrate as soon as their visa petition is filed and approved by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.59</u></p><p>The total number of family&amp;based visas which can be issued in any one year is 480,000, and these are distributed according to a hierarchical preference system.60 The following chart summarizes the INA preference system with the yearly quota assigned to each category and approximate backlog waiting time.61</p><p>As this chart demonstrates, family&amp;based immigration is largely based on the parent&amp;child relationship. For purposes of the INA, a “child” is only a minor child, which denies parent&amp;child relationship where the son or daughter is older than twenty&amp;one years of age or married.62 <u>Moreover, to qualify as a child, an individual must fall into one of the six statutorily defined categories of children, which, while possibly more inclusive than in the past (because, for example, adopted children and children born out of wedlock are included), reflect what one would think of as a child in a nuclear family: (1) children born in wedlock,63 (2) stepchildren,64 (3) legitimated children,65 (4) children born out of wedlock,66 (5) adopted children,67 or (6) orphan children from abroad who will be adopted by American parents.68</u></p><p><u style="background-color: yellow;">The consequence of this narrow conception of family is</u><u>, of course, that if a child living in a </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">non&amp;traditional family formation wants to immigrate</u><u>³with her family³based on a family petition, she </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">will not be able to do so</u><u>. If a child is trying to immigrate with her aunt who was her primary caretaker since birth, she will not be permitted to do so, as the aunt would not fit into either category of relatives recognized on a family petition</u>. Similarly, if a grandmother of a child wanted to enter the United States with her grandchild who calls her “mama” because it was this grandmother who raised her, this relationship would not be one recognized as a family petition. While from the child’s perspective, the aunt in the former case, and the grandmother in the latter, might be the most significant relatives in this child’s life, in neither case is there an allowance for this reality under U.S. immigration law. </p><p>Imagine, for example, a young woman who lives in Nicaragua and is a Nicaraguan citizen. She marries a U.S. citizen and is immediately eligible for a visa to immigrate to the United States. This young woman has cared for her now twelve year-­old nephew since his birth. Although the boy’s mother cannot care for him, she will not consent to any adoption. She would allow him, however, to move to the United States with his aunt. Unfortunately, if the boy were to arrive with his aunt at the U.S. embassy in Nicaragua, they would be told that because this woman is not legally or biologically the boy’s mother, they would not be able to immigrate together on a family petition.69 This tragic scenario underscores the fact that the INA’s conception of family is an unnecessarily narrow conception which may not reflect many of the families of those children who emigrate.</p><p>&nbsp;2. Cancellation of Removal Based on Family </p><p><u>The narrow notion of family which is codified in the section of the INA that governs family-­based immigration also permeates the law governing the removal of certain nonpermanent residents. This law is part of IRRIRA and allows otherwise removable nonpermanent residents to remain in the United States, if the nonpermanent resident satisfies certain residency and moral character requirements and “establishes that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien’s spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence</u>. The definition of a “child,” as held by the Supreme Court in a case involving this statute’s precursor, explicitly excludes any individual who does not fit within the INA’s statutory definition of “child,” even if that individual’s “relationship with the deportable alien closely resembles that of a parent and child”</p><p>The case before the Supreme Court involved a woman named Virginia Hector who was a native and citizen of Dominica in the West Indies. Ms. Hector entered the United States in April 1975 as a nonimmigrant visitor, but overstayed her visa and remained in the United States without legal status from April 30, 1975 until 1983, when the United States instituted deportation proceedings against her. Ms. Hector lived with and cared for the youngest of her four children, a ten-­year-­old boy, and two of her nieces who were United States citizens aged ten and eleven. The nieces’ parents lived in Dominica at the time. </p><p><u>The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) concluded, as a matter of law, that a niece is not a “child” within the meaning of the deportation statu</u>te.72 But the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit granted Ms. Hector’s petition for review and remanded the case to the BIA, holding that the BIA erred by not sufficiently considering whether Ms. Hector’s relationship with her nieces was the functional equivalent of a parent-­child relationship.73 The remand order instructed the BIA to ascertain whether Ms. Hector had a “parental type relationship” with her nieces, and, if so, to determine whether the nieces would experience extreme hardship as a result of Ms. Hector’s deportation </p><p><u>In issuing the remand order, the Third Circuit relied on its own precedent in Tovar v. I.N.S., which held that the BIA should have considered the hardship to a nonpermanent resident's grandchild where the relationship between the two closely resembled that of a parent to a child.74 In Tovar, the Third Circuit reasoned that Ms. Tovar and her grandson Christian comprised a family and shared the relationship of mother to child:</u></p><p>Christian is emotionally attached and financially dependent on Maria Tovar. Testimony at the hearing indicated that he thought of her as his mother, despite his having been informed of the identity of his natural mother. Furthermore, we recognize that grandmother headed households are worthy of fundamental respect. Therefore we believe it proper to extend the same privilege that the suspension provision affords the nuclear family to this grandmother-­headed family.75 </p><p><u>Unfortunately, the Supreme Court overruled this precedent in I.N.S. v. Hector, explicitly holding that the Court is "constrained to hold that Congress, through the plain language of the statute, precluded this functional approach to defining 'child." 7 6 Although relying on the plain language of the statute, the Court also noted legislative history which "corroborated" the statute's plain language</u>:</p><p>With respect to suspension of deportation, the Senate rejected a draft of the bill that focused on the hardship to the 'immediate family.' See S. 716, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., (1951). In a prepared analysis of S. 716, the INS expressed concern about this undefined term that the INS considered 'obscure, uncertain, and difficult, if not impossible, to administer' since the language could 'conceivably be claimed to include any relative of the alien, by blood or marriage, who might be living with him in his household.' 4 INS, Analysis of S. 716, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., 244-2 and 244-3 (1951) (emphasis in original). Instead, the INS asked Congress to list the 'particular relatives who are intended to be described.' Id., at 244-3. The bill that was eventually passed contained the 'parent, spouse, or child' language that is now in effect. 77</p><p><u>Explicitly deferring to the will of Congress, the Supreme Court, in essence, concluded that it is powerless to extend to functional families the provisions of U.S. immigration law which are meant to protect family integrity and the welfare of children.7</u></p><p><u>More than twenty years after Hector, the case continues to bind U.S. courts.</u> In one case, Macario Moreno applied for cancellation of removal on the ground that his removal would cause hardship for his grandchildren who were citizens of the United States. Mr. Moreno had legal custody of his grandchildren and was in the process of adopting them, but the adoption had not been finalized. The children's mother had already been removed to Mexico. While not questioning the parent-child relationship between Mr. Moreno and the children, the Ninth Circuit held that Mr. Moreno's grandchildren did not qualify as 'children' under the INA although Mr. Moreno was in loco parentis, because Congress had specifically precluded such a functional approach to defining the term 'child' for cancellation of removal purposes.79</p><p>At least one circuit, while acknowledging Hector as binding precedent, has lamented its holding and explained that "the INA's definition of 'child' may be far out of step with the times, and may have a particularly deleterious effect on aliens whose culture's definition of 'family' is legitimately broader than the traditional definition of those related by blood or adoption."8 0 As this line of cases explains, it would be up to Congress to conform the definition of family to one that reflects the broader, more inclusive conception of family.</p><p>3. The INA's Refugee Provisions</p><p><u>The definition of family in the context of U.S. immigration law is also relevant when discussing the circumstances under which children can immigrate to, or remain in, the United States with a functional parent who is granted asylum</u>. The Attorney General may grant asylum to a "refugee,""1 which is defined as "a person unable or unwilling to return to the country of that person's nationality or habitual residence because of past persecution or because of a wellfounded fear of future persecution on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group,82 or political opinion."83 <u>While a spouse or child of an alien who is granted asylum may also be granted the status of asylee and thereby immigrate to or remain in the United States for the sake of family unity, only those children meeting the INA's definition of "child" may do so</u>.84 In a recent unpublished case, Tamrat v. Mukasey, in which a native and citizen from Ethiopia, Etsgenet Tamrat, applied for asylum for both herself and the son of her common law husband, for example, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit explained that the son could not be a derivative beneficiary of the applicant as he did not meet the INA's definition of child.85</p><p><u>As the child in Tamrat v. Mukasey was the son of Tamrat's common law husband, it seems possible that Tamrat was a functional parent for this child and that the child considered Tamrat his mother.</u> Tamrat likely had nurtured this child, and may have been the main-or one of the main-providers of the child's "psychological, physical, intellectual, and spiritual care."86 <u>But this was irrelevant in the eyes of the court as Tamrat's common law son did not meet the INA's statutory definition of child.</u></p><p><u>Therefore, in context of family based immigration and cancellation of removal, the INA's definition of "child" in its refugee provisions precludes consideration of such functional relationships as persons standing in loco parentis-including a primary caregiver grandmother, or another family member who has served as the de facto parent for a child-thereby narrowing the circumstances under which many families may remain together.</u></p><p><br></p><h4>Plan broadens the definition of family to include any kinship network</h4><p><strong>Hawthorne 7 Monique Hawthorne is a Pro Tem Instructor at the University of Oregon School of Law (Monique, “FAMILY UNITY IN IMMIGRATION LAW: BROADENING THE SCOPE OF “FAMILY”,” Lewis and Clark Law Review, Vol. 11:3, 9/15/07) // </strong>SR&nbsp;SNAF = Standard North American Family</p><p><br></p><p><u>C.

The North American Family Model Versus Other Cultural Family Models </u>The SNAF image may be more prevalent in movies, television shows, magazines, and books, but this does not make it the only family model in the U.S. Many movies and television shows depict fathers who work, mothers who cook and clean (she may have a job, but her dominant role is caretaker), and children who are all in school.103 “Scholars concerned about the impact of<u> such images </u>point to those who blame family structures that deviate from th[e] norm for many of society’s problems and who suggest policies that ignore or<u> </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">punish families that don’t fit the construct.”</u>104 <u>The cultural values of these “deviant” types of families are considered abnormal </u>to the SNAF. In reality though, other family models exist all over the world and throughout the United States.</p><p>Single person and two-person households have come to play an ever more important role, as have other models—grandparent-grandchild households, for example—in which others, relatives and non-relatives, live in the household, either in addition to or instead of the expected nuclear family members . . . . Despite its diminished reality,<u> immigration law is based on the assumptions of the dominant model.105</u></p><p><u>The question remains, though, if family dynamics are changing in the United States, why do immigration laws continue to preference the SNAF model of family?</u></p><p>In most of the different ethnic groups immigrating to the United States, family structures are multigenerational.106 Growing up in the Asian culture, I myself have experienced a multigenerational family with cousins and grandparents living under the same roof. For most of my life in the United States, my paternal grandfather was a primary caregiver. My cousins in Taiwan lived with our maternal grandparents, two sets of aunts and uncles, and all of their children. Each family member contributed to the well-being—both financially and emotionally—of the entire family.</p><p>Many Latin American communities are known for viewing entire villages as helping to raise the children of all.107 “[T]he most significant characteristic of the Chicano family has been identified as familism . . . .”108 Researchers have found that Mexican-Americans, when compared to Anglo-Americans, are more likely to rely on relatives for emotional support.109</p><p>In ethnographic studies of African-American families, researchers have found relations that exist “between fictive kin (non-blood kin who relationally define themselves as family) are as strong and lasting as those established by blood,”110 and provide support and mutual aid in an extended family.</p><p>None of these models are “better” than the North American model, but the are different. Even so, U.S. immigration law seems to prefer the North American Model, which defines family, perhaps, even more narrowly than the actual, average North American family.111</p><p><u>A question to ask ourselves is why we seem to hold immigrants seeking admission into the United States to a narrowly standard of “family” </u>than we do our own native families already living the U.S.? If our own American society cannot reflect the ideals of our laws, how can we expect others to conform to our idealized standards? For example, the United States may deny admission to a foreign national with a criminal history.112 However, a United States citizen with a criminal history who goes on vacation will be admitted back to the United States.113 One possible explanation is the desire to limit admissions to people who we think will add to the quality of our society and to not admit those people who will add to or exacerbate our society’s problems. We, as members of our society, can decide who we want to include.114 While this idea may be applicable when immigration laws exclude criminals,115 prostitutes,116 and people with communicable diseases,117 it loses applicability when applied to family models. The function of family is subjective and unique to each family unit. It is clear that<u> “[t]he idea of what constitutes a family and its positive characteristics needs to be expanded.”</u>118 Although advocating that each family be allowed to define themselves for immigration purposes would be ideal, this solution would lead to an unworkable rule. Instead<em>, </em><em style="background-color: yellow;">the United States should broaden its family categories so that they are broader and more flexible</em><u>, similar to Canada’s immigration laws.</u></p><p><u>2. A Broader Definition of “Family”: Canada’s Example</u></p><p><em>The United States should adopt an immigration model that is similar to Canada’s model</em><u>. </u>Like the United States, Canada has a policy for family reunification. However, unlike the U.S., Canada’s policy is more effectively carried out in its immigration statutes.<u> Canada</u>’s Immigration and Refugee Protection Act of 2001 119 <u>expanded the definition of “family” to include </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">family members that are not presently included under U.S. immigration law</u><u>. The first apparent difference is the inclusion of a “common-law partner or conjugal partner.”</u>120 This allows same-sex partners to enter Canada as a member of the family. Under the INA, the U.S. doesn’t acknowledge same-sex partners as “family,” even if the country of origin acknowledges the two as a married couple. In order to adopt a policy similar to Canada’s policy, the U.S. does not need to recognize the same-sex marriage, but merely that same-sex partners have family bonds that should be protected under United States’ immigration laws.</p><p><u>Canada also allows “the mother or father of the sponsor’s mother or father” to enter as a member of the family.121 </u>Therefore, a petitioning citizen or legal permanent resident would be able to bring their grandparent to Canada. The inability to bring in one’s grandparent to the United States under existing family preference categories, is a source of major frustration for many immigrants, especially if they come from a culture where families are multigenerational and grandparents are considered part of the “nuclear” family.122<u> If the U.S. is to effectuate its policy for family reunification, then </u><em>Congress should amend the “immediate relative” category to include grandparents</em><u>. </u>Hence, when birthright U.S. citizens, naturalized citizens, or legal permanent residents reach the age of twenty-one123 they would be able to petition for the admission of their grandparents.<u> This </u>chance <u>would solve some of the mixed-status family’s problems.124</u></p><p><u>For some U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, another source of frustration is not being able to sponsor relatives whom they have raised as their own children, but that are not necessarily their biological children.125 </u>However, Canada has recognized that<u> these types of relationships must be included within the definition of “family,” and are necessary if family reunification is to be more than just an aspirational goal. If an orphan is under the age of eighteen and is unmarried, Canada will allow him or her to enter as long as the child is “a child of the sponsor’s mother or father” (a brother or sister), “a child of a child of the sponsor’s mother or father” (a nephew or niece), or “a child of the sponsor’s child” (a grandchild).126 The United States should adopt these provisions.</u></p><p><u>Canada’s </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">broadest expansion of “family” is the inclusion of any relative, regardless of age, as a member of the “family class.”</u><u> </u>If the petitioner does not have any family members that fall within the aforementioned family categories, the petitioner is allowed to bring in any relative.127<u> Canada recognizes that </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">despite</u><u> the fact that someone may have </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">no blood relatives, he or she may still have family-like relations that</u><u> are worthy of protection by the country’s immigration laws. This final category provides a necessary element of flexibility to encompass different notions of “family.”</u></p><p><u>3. Broadening the Scope of “Family” and its Effects on Mixed-Status Families</u></p><p><u>The definition of “family” cannot remain static because the status quo has led to problems with family reunification and created mixed-status families. </u>As discussed above, undocumented immigrants often desire to legitimize their presence, but because of the possibility of family separation, they tend to avoid drawing attention to themselves.<u> Many of the </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">problems facing mixed-status families would be solved if they could have entered legally in the first plac</u><u>e. Assuming arguendo that a majority of people seeking entry have some familial contact to the United States, they would have more opportunities to seek sponsorship among those already in the United States. After receiving permission to enter, their families would then be derivative beneficiaries. </u>The United States could even provide a threshold standard in order to take advantage of the family petitions. For example<u>, Canada has considered a standard requiring the sponsored individual to be “known and emotionally important to” the sponsor.</u>128<u> If the </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">“known and emotionally important” standard is adopted in the U</u><u>nited </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">S</u><u>tates, </u><u style="background-color: yellow;">Congress could create factors for an immigration officer to use, such as actual familial kinship relationship</u><u>, length of acquaintance, length of shared residence, geographical distance between residences, knowledge of each other’s personal histories, number of shared experiences, and strength of bond, which would aid in a flexible application of derivative beneficiary status.</u></p><p>Critics of expanding the scope of “family” may argue that the Department of Homeland Security—more specifically the INS—is already overwhelmed by the number of entrants, pointing to the log jam in the priority dates. They may claim that an expansion of those who may qualify as “family” will burden an already overburdened agency and that examining each applicant’s relationship would be too cumbersome and difficult. Consider, however, that the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) recently received a nearly 4.8% budget increase under President Bush’s Fiscal Year 2006 budget.129 This equals a $6.7 billion total budget. If people are given more legal avenues to enter the United States, fewer people will attempt crossing the borders illegally. The money saved could then be diverted to deal with a heavier volume of family applications. Not only are there enough resources to administer this broader definition of “family,”</p><p>[C]ountries find it to their advantage to admit close family members of migrants. Often they are able to facilitate the integration process and to enable the migrant to establish him- or herself more quickly . . . . The presence of family members also reduces remittance abroad—a useful benefit for the receiving countries since the immigrants will spend the money on consumption or investment in their new home country.130</p><p>When all factors are considered, a broader scope of “family” seems to be a win-win situation.</p>
